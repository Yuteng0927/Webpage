### Research Summary
The trimeric human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1) creates pores through which copper can enter human cells. When copper levels are high, hCTR1 is taken into the cell via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, reducing its surface abundance. However, it is not yet known how cells regulate the remaining hCTR1 on the cell surface to prevent excessive copper uptake. To address this question, this study utilized super-resolution localization microscopy and a single-molecule oligomeric state quantification assay to examine the oligomeric states of hCTR1 complexes in fixed COS7 cells.
