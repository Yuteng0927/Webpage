### Research Summary
The first step in this process is the localization extraction of individual molecules within the image. This is accomplished by using specialized algorithms that detect the signal emitted from fluorescent markers that are attached to molecules of interest. 
The next step is to reconstruct a 2D/3D image from the data obtained in the previous step.
