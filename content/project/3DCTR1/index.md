### Research Summary
Copper enters human cells through pores formed by trimeric human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1). Elevated Cu induces clathrin-dependent endocytosis of  hCTR1 and decreases the hCTR1 surface abundance by half.  However, it remains unclear how cells minimize the Cu-uptake activity of the remaining surface hCTR1.  This study examined the oligomeric states of hCTR1 complexes in fixed COS7 cells using super-resolution localization microscopy and single-molecule oligomeric state quantification assay.  We found that the hCTR1 on the plasma membrane exists dominantly in the trimeric form (~80%) under basal conditions and shifts to monomeric states (~50%) under Cu stressed conditions. This finding suggests cells may further modulate the oligomer distributions of the surface hCTR1 to reduce cellular Cu-uptake and provide insight into the hCTR1 transport mechanism.
