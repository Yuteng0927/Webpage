abstract: The ability to extract kinetic interaction parameters from single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer trajectories without the need for solving complex single-molecule differential equations has the potential to address some of the critical biophysical questions. Here, we provide a noise-free single-molecule interaction simulation (SMIS) tool to give the expected dwell-time distributions and relative populations of each FRET level based on the assigned kinetic model and to dissect kinetic interaction parameters from single-molecule FRET trajectories. The method provides the expected dwell-time distributions, average transition rates, and relative populations of each FRET level based on the assigned kinetic model. By comparing with ground truth data and experimental data, we demonstrated that SMIS is useful to quantify the interaction kinetic rate constants without using the traditional single-molecule analytical solution approach.
