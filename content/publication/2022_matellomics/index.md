abstract: Excess intracellular Cu perturbs cellular redox balance and thus causes diseases. However, the relationship between cellular redox status and Cu homeostasis and how such an interplay is coordinated within cellular compartments has not yet been well established. Using combined approaches of organelle-specific redox sensor Grx1-roGFP2 and non-targeted proteomics, we investigate the real-time Cu-dependent antioxidant defenses of mitochondria and cytosol in live HEK293 cells. The Cu-dependent real-time imaging experiments show that CuCl2 treatment results in increased oxidative stress in both cytosol and mitochondria. In contrast, subsequent excess Cu removal by bathocuproine sulfonate, a Cu chelating reagent, lowers oxidative stress in mitochondria but causes even higher oxidative stress in the cytosol. The proteomic data reveal that several mitochondrial proteins, but not cytosolic ones, undergo significant abundance change under Cu treatments. The proteomic analysis also shows that proteins with significant changes are related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glutathione synthesis. The differences in redox behaviors and protein profiles in different cellular compartments reveal distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic response mechanisms upon Cu-induced oxidative stress. These findings provide insights into how redox and Cu homeostasis interplay by modulating specific protein expressions at the subcellular levels, shedding light on understanding the effects of Cu-induced redox misregulation on the diseases.
