I am currently a fifth year PhD candidate in the department of Chemistry at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). I am currently working with Prof. [Tai-Yen Chen](http://chen.chem.uh.edu/) on investigating subcellular compartmental and protein behavior against oxidative stress using single-molecule techniques, with the goals to understand how these antioxidant defense correlates with neurodegenerative diseases. 

I have extensive experience with cell imaging, microscopy and cellular fluorescent image data analysis using programming languages. My research interests include:
<!-- <br> -->
#### Cellular behavior using single-molecule imaging techniques:
Projects:

a. Protein kinetic behavior under oxidative stress via single-molecule tracking\
b. Protein oligomer states quantification via 3D single-molecule super-resolution imaging\
c. Subcellular compartmental antioxidant defense via redox-active fluorescent sensor\
d. Imaging platform optimization via light sheet imaging\
e. Dissection of interaction kinetics via single-molecule interaction simulation  

#### Cellular biological data analysis pipeline development:
Projects:

a. Data processing pipeline for single-molecule image reconstruction\
b. GUI development for single-molecule super-resolved fluorescent image processing


Furthermore, I am proficient in programming languages such as MATLAB and Python with advanced knowledge in data classification, numerical simulation, and machine learning algorithms, which equipped me with diverse perspectives to analyze data and extract maximum value from it. I have also completed several coding projects utilizing Python.

#### Coding Projects:

a. Web application for Exploring National Parks\
b. Magnetic Maps Inclinations Prediction by Deep Learning\
c. YouTube Data Extraction and Visualization\
d. Rotten Tomatoes Movies Analysis by Machine Leaning
